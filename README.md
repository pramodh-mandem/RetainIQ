# WorkforceIQ

**HR analytics and attrition-risk platform** — a normalised PostgreSQL schema, an
analytical SQL layer, a Power BI semantic model with time-intelligence DAX, and a
scikit-learn model whose output feeds back into the database.

### **[▶ Open the live dashboard](https://vuday3336.github.io/WorkforceIQ--Analysis/)**

Six findings, a tenure-controlled department ranking, and a filterable
flight-risk watchlist. Every figure on it is computed by the SQL view named in
its section — nothing is hand-entered.

## 1. Business scenario

Everline Corp, a 1,470-employee company across 6 departments (Sales, Engineering,
HR, Finance, Operations, Customer Support), has seen attrition creep up over the
last two fiscal years. Leadership wants a single trusted view of attrition trends
by department / role / tenure, the underlying drivers, and a proactive list of
employees currently at elevated flight risk — replacing an ad-hoc quarterly PDF
report.

The headline result is that **the quarterly PDF was ranking departments on a
metric that rewarded the ones that stopped hiring.** See finding 6.

### What is real and what is constructed

Stated first, because it changes how every number below should be read.

Built on the public **IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance** dataset
— 1,470 real rows. Every **driver variable and the attrition label are used
unmodified**: monthly income, job satisfaction, environment satisfaction,
work-life balance, overtime, performance rating, stock options, salary hike,
distance from home, age, gender, marital status, education, job level, years at
company, and the Attrition flag.

The source is a **single dateless snapshot**, so anything time-shaped had to be
constructed to make SCD modelling and time-intelligence DAX possible: employee
names, hire and termination dates, the per-year compensation and review rows, the
manager hierarchy, the voluntary/involuntary split, and the six-department
overlay. Full mapping table in [`docs/sql_findings.md`](docs/sql_findings.md).

**Consequence:** findings 2–6 are about *drivers* and are real signal from the
source data. Finding 1's quarter-over-quarter *slope* is partly by construction
and is labelled as a technique demonstration rather than an insight.

Headcount is 1,470 rather than a round "~2,000" because padding the population
with ~530 invented employees would have diluted a real attrition label with
synthetic ones and made every rate below partly fictional.

        smallint quarter

```

Three design decisions worth calling out:

- **`employee_id` is a natural key**, carried from the source HRIS extract rather
  than a surrogate serial, so a refreshed extract does not require remapping
  identities across the model and the scoring job.
- **`compensation_history` and `performance_reviews` are effective-dated** (SCD
  Type 2 pattern) rather than one mutable row per employee. This is what makes
  point-in-time questions — *"what was this person paid when they resigned?"* —
  answerable at all.
- **`attrition_risk_scores` has a composite PK on `(employee_id, scored_date,
  model_name)`.** Every scoring run is retained instead of overwritten, so model
  drift is observable rather than lost.

`dim_date` is not in the original brief but is required: Power BI time-intelligence
DAX needs a contiguous marked date table, and deriving one from fact dates alone
leaves gaps in any period with no terminations.

## 3. The analytical SQL layer

Eight views in [`sql/views/`](sql/views/), one file each. Full write-ups with
method and caveats in **[`docs/sql_findings.md`](docs/sql_findings.md)**.

**Company baseline: 1,470 employees, 1,233 active, 237 departures, 16.12% crude
attrition rate.**

| # | View | Business question | Headline finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | [`vw_attrition_by_department`](sql/views/01_vw_attrition_by_department.sql) | Which departments are worst, and is one bad quarter distorting it? | HR **18.2%** and Sales **13.5%** rolling 4-quarter vs Finance **1.0%**. HR's single-quarter rate was 2.5% — reading that alone concludes HR is fine. |
| 2 | [`vw_tenure_cohort_attrition`](sql/views/02_vw_tenure_cohort_attrition.sql) | Do we lose people early or once established? | 0–1 yr has the highest *rate* (**36.4%**) but 6.8% of outflow. **1–3 yr is 36.3% of everyone who leaves.** Rate alone points the budget at the wrong cohort. |
| 3 | [`vw_compensation_percentile`](sql/views/03_vw_compensation_percentile.sql) | Do people underpaid *relative to peers* leave more? | Bottom in-role quartile **19.5%** vs Q3 **13.6%** — but Q4 ticks back up to 14.6%. Real, ~6pp, **non-monotonic**. |
| 4 | [`vw_manager_span_attrition`](sql/views/04_vw_manager_span_attrition.sql) | Do managers with bigger teams lose more people? | **No relationship.** Flat at 14.0% / 16.6% / 16.3% across 6–10, 11–15, 16+. A negative result, reported as one. |
| 5 | [`vw_overtime_satisfaction_attrition`](sql/views/05_vw_overtime_satisfaction_attrition.sql) | Do overtime and low satisfaction compound? | **Overtime + low satisfaction = 36.6%, 2.27× base and 5.3× the 6.9% of employees with neither.** Overtime alone beats low satisfaction alone. |
| 6 | [`vw_department_attrition_controlled`](sql/views/06_vw_department_attrition_controlled.sql) | Who has a *retention* problem vs a young workforce? | **Engineering's 17.6% is entirely tenure mix (SAR 1.01).** Sales (1.36) and HR (1.40) are the real problems. |
| 7 | [`vw_attrition_risk_watchlist`](sql/views/07_vw_attrition_risk_watchlist.sql) | Who is at risk right now? | Joins model output to the human context — manager, pay position, overtime — that makes a probability actionable. |
| 8 | [`vw_dim_employee`](sql/views/08_vw_dim_employee.sql) | — | The conformed wide dimension Power BI imports as `DimEmployee`. |

### The one worth explaining in an interview — finding 6

Tenure is the strongest single predictor of leaving (36.4% at 0–1 years, 10.4% at
10+). Departments do not have the same tenure mix. A department that doubled in
size is mostly 0–2 year employees — the cohort that leaves most — so it posts a
high crude rate **even if it retains people better than average at every tenure
level**. Ranking on the crude rate rewards departments that stopped hiring.

The fix is **indirect standardisation**, borrowed from epidemiology, where the
identical problem appears as comparing mortality across regions with different age
structures:

1. Compute the company-wide attrition rate **for each tenure cohort** — the
   *standard schedule*.
2. Apply that schedule to each department's **own tenure mix** → *expected leavers*.
3. `SAR = observed / expected`.

| Department | Head | Avg tenure | Observed | Expected | Crude rate | **SAR** | Verdict |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|---|
| HR | 52 | 5.8 | 12 | 8.6 | 23.1% | **1.40** | Worse than tenure predicts |
| Sales | 409 | 7.1 | 90 | 66.1 | 22.0% | **1.36** | Worse than tenure predicts |
| Engineering | 631 | 6.3 | 111 | 109.7 | 17.6% | **1.01** | In line with tenure mix |
| Operations | 145 | 8.1 | 10 | 20.4 | 6.9% | **0.49** | Better than tenure predicts |
| Customer Support | 131 | 8.9 | 9 | 18.5 | 6.9% | **0.49** | Better than tenure predicts |
| Finance | 102 | 15.0 | 5 | 13.7 | 4.9% | **0.37** | Better than tenure predicts |

**Engineering accounts for 111 of 237 departures — 47% of all outflow — and on the
old report it looked like the problem to solve. Its SAR is 1.01.** It loses almost
exactly what its tenure mix predicts. That is a hiring-volume consequence, not a
retention failure, and a retention task force sent there would find nothing to fix.
**Sales is where it belongs**: same effect size as HR, across 409 people rather
than 52.

*What this does not claim:* SAR adjusts for **tenure mix only**. Role mix, pay
position and overtime exposure remain uncontrolled. Two departments with the same
SAR are comparable on tenure, not on everything.

## 4. Power BI

[`powerbi/`](powerbi/) — a **PBIP project with a full TMDL semantic model**:
14 tables, 6 relationships, and **22 documented DAX measures**
([`powerbi/measures.dax`](powerbi/measures.dax)). Page-by-page spec in
[`powerbi/REPORT_BUILD_GUIDE.md`](powerbi/REPORT_BUILD_GUIDE.md).

**Opens with no setup**: the model imports from `data/powerbi/*.csv`, so the
report populates the moment you open it — no database password, no server, no
certificate.

Those CSVs are not hand-made extracts. Each one is the output of running the
actual shipped `.sql` view (`generators/export_for_powerbi.py`), so the SQL
layer still computes every number on every page.

### Why not a live PostgreSQL connection?

The first version of this model did connect straight to Postgres, which is the
better line on a CV. It was the wrong call for a portfolio artefact:

- **A reviewer without the database password sees a report full of `(Blank)`.**
  A report nobody can open is worth nothing.
- **It did not work reliably even for me.** Supabase's connection pooler
  presents a certificate that chains to no root in the Windows trust store, so
  Npgsql rejects it and every table fails with *"The remote certificate is
  invalid according to the validation procedure."* Getting past that needs
  either certificate validation disabled or the Supabase CA installed into
  Trusted Root Certification Authorities — neither of which belongs in a
  "clone and open" experience.
- **The free tier pauses the database out from under you.** Supabase allows two
  active projects per organisation; create a third and one of the others is
  paused automatically. That happened to this database mid-build. A report whose
  data source can vanish on someone else's schedule is not a portfolio piece.

The `ServerName` / `DatabaseName` parameters are still in the model and the
live-connection M is documented in
[`powerbi/REPORT_BUILD_GUIDE.md`](powerbi/REPORT_BUILD_GUIDE.md); the database
itself is live and populated, and `generators/verify_parity.py` proves the
views return identical results there and on DuckDB.

### On the missing `.pbix`

A `.pbix` is a binary only Power BI Desktop can write. **PBIP/TMDL is the
format you want in source control anyway** — a `.pbix` cannot be diffed,
reviewed or merged, which is why Microsoft built PBIP. Desktop opens the
`.pbip` natively; `File → Save As` produces a binary in one step.

### Selected measures

```dax
Attrition Rate = DIVIDE ( [Terminated Count], [Total Headcount] )

-- point-in-time headcount; ALL() is required, or the date relationship
-- restricts this to people who already left
Headcount (EOP) =
VAR AsOf = MAX ( DimDate[date_key] )
RETURN
    CALCULATE (
        COUNTROWS ( DimEmployee ),
        FILTER (
            ALL ( DimEmployee ),
            DimEmployee[hire_date] <= AsOf
                && ( ISBLANK ( DimEmployee[termination_date] )
                     || DimEmployee[termination_date] > AsOf )
        )
    )

Rolling 12-Month Attrition Rate =
VAR AsOf   = MAX ( DimDate[date_key] )
VAR Window = DATESINPERIOD ( DimDate[date_key], AsOf, -12, MONTH )
RETURN
    DIVIDE (
        CALCULATE ( [Terminated Count], Window ),
        AVERAGEX ( FILTER ( Window, DimDate[is_month_end] ), [Headcount (EOP)] )
    )

YoY Attrition Change =
    [Attrition Rate (Period)]
        - CALCULATE ( [Attrition Rate (Period)], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR ( DimDate[date_key] ) )
```

`Flight Risk Score (Rule-Based)` implements a transparent weighted checklist so the
report can show a human-designed heuristic beside the trained model. They correlate
only **r = 0.47** — and that gap is the argument for the model.

### The report

**Page 1 — Executive Overview.** Headline KPIs, the crude vs tenure-adjusted
comparison, the quarterly trend against its rolling 4-quarter window, and the
department scorecard showing observed against expected leavers.

![Executive Overview](docs/dashboard_screenshots/01_executive.png)

**Page 2 — Tenure & Cohort Analysis.** Headcount and attrition rate per cohort,
each cohort's share of total outflow, and the department × cohort matrix. Note
that the highest *rate* and the largest *share of leavers* are different cohorts.

![Tenure and Cohort Analysis](docs/dashboard_screenshots/02_tenure.png)

**Page 3 — Compensation & Satisfaction.** Attrition by in-role pay quartile, the
overtime × satisfaction cross-segment with lift against the base rate, and the
span-of-control chart reporting a negative result.

![Compensation and Satisfaction](docs/dashboard_screenshots/03_compensation.png)

**Page 4 — Attrition Risk Watchlist.** Every active employee ranked by modelled
flight risk, with the rule-based heuristic beside the model score, plus
department and tier slicers. This is the page that makes it an operational tool
rather than a retrospective report.

![Attrition Risk Watchlist](docs/dashboard_screenshots/04_watchlist.png)

The same findings, from the same SQL views, are also on the
**[live web dashboard](https://vuday3336.github.io/WorkforceIQ--Analysis/)**.

---

## 5. The model

[`notebooks/attrition_risk_model.ipynb`](notebooks/attrition_risk_model.ipynb) —
committed with executed outputs and charts.

**Features are assembled by querying the same SQL views the dashboard reads**, not
re-derived in pandas. If the definition of "pay percentile within role" changes, it
changes in one place and both the model and the report move together.

### Results (held-out 25% test set, 368 employees, 59 leavers)

| | Logistic Regression | Random Forest |
|---|--:|--:|
| Recall (leavers) | **0.66** | 0.22 |
| Precision (leavers) | 0.35 | 0.57 |
| ROC-AUC | 0.739 | 0.749 |
| **5-fold CV PR-AUC** | **0.507 ± 0.065** | **0.511 ± 0.034** |

**The two models are statistically tied** — the gap in cross-validated PR-AUC
(0.004) is well inside the fold-to-fold standard deviation. The forest buys no real
accuracy, so the watchlist ships on the **logistic regression**, where a coefficient
answers the only question a manager ever asks: *why this person?*

Accuracy is excluded on purpose: at a 16.1% base rate, predicting "nobody leaves"
scores 83.9%. Everything is judged on recall and PR-AUC, and for a retention
watchlist recall is the right bias — a false positive costs one coffee
conversation, a false negative costs a replacement hire.

![Feature importance](docs/charts/feature_importance.png)

### What matters, by permutation importance

| Feature | Drop in PR-AUC when shuffled |
|---|--:|
| `tenure_years_log` | 0.220 |
| `overtime` | 0.178 |
| `monthly_income` | 0.102 |
| `tenure_years` | 0.092 |
| `job_role` | 0.059 |
| `pct_vs_role_average` | 0.044 |

**Tenure, overtime and compensation position — in that order.** The ranking agrees
with the SQL findings, which is the reassuring part: two independent methods on the
same data reaching the same conclusion. Overtime is the strongest *actionable*
driver, matching the 2.27× lift in finding 5.

`business_travel_Travel_Frequently` carries the largest single coefficient (odds
ratio ≈ 3.7) but ranks lower on permutation importance because it sits on a smaller
slice of the population — a good illustration of why both readings are shown.

<img src="docs/charts/precision_recall.png" width="49%"> <img src="docs/charts/confusion_matrix.png" width="49%">

### Scoring

All 1,233 active employees are scored and written to `attrition_risk_scores`.
Tiers are **quantiles of the active population** (top decile → High, next 20% →
Medium), not a 0.5 probability cutoff: under balanced class weights a 0.5 threshold
flags several hundred people, which no HR team can action. That is a capacity
decision, not a statistical one, and it is documented rather than buried.

### A bug worth documenting

An earlier version of the data generator jittered hire dates for **active employees
only**, which placed every leaver on an exact integer tenure and every stayer just
above one. That class-dependent gap was free signal the model happily exploited,
and it surfaced as an implausible **71% attrition rate in the under-1-year band**.
Fixed in [`generators/build_dataset.py`](generators/build_dataset.py) by drawing
the within-year offset identically for both classes.

It is left in the write-up because it is the whole argument for point-in-time
feature stores: synthetic-data leakage is quiet, and it flatters your metrics.

---

## 6. Running it

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Rebuild everything from the raw CSV** (deterministic — same bytes every time):

Order matters: `train_attrition_model.py` must run **before** `build_seed_sql.py`,
because the seed script embeds the scored watchlist it produces.

```bash
python generators/build_dataset.py         # normalise + synthesise the time dimension
python generators/train_attrition_model.py # train, evaluate, score, write charts
python generators/build_seed_sql.py        # emit sql/seed_data.sql (includes scores)
python generators/run_views_local.py       # run all 8 views on DuckDB, no server needed
python generators/build_notebook.py        # regenerate the executed notebook
python generators/build_powerbi.py         # regenerate the TMDL semantic model
python generators/build_dashboard.py       # rebuild the web dashboard
```

`run_views_local.py` executes **the exact `.sql` files that ship to Postgres**
against DuckDB, so the SQL layer can be validated and every figure in the docs
regenerated without a database server running.

**Load into PostgreSQL:**

```bash
cp .env.example .env     # add your DATABASE_URL (session pooler, port 5432)
python generators/load_to_postgres.py
python generators/verify_parity.py
```

The loader runs four steps in order — schema, seed, views, then
[`sql/rls_policies.sql`](sql/rls_policies.sql). That last step is never skipped,
because `schema.sql` opens with `DROP TABLE ... CASCADE`, and dropping a table
takes its RLS policies with it. Security applied as a one-off migration is
destroyed by the next rebuild and the tables come back open with nobody
noticing — which is exactly what happened once during this build and is why the
policies now live in the build script.

**Posture:** anonymous *read* is intentional — it is what lets the hosted
dashboard query the database with no server-side secret, over a public demo
dataset with synthesised names. Anonymous *write* is closed twice over: RLS with
SELECT-only policies, plus `INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/TRUNCATE` revoked from `anon`
and `authenticated` outright. All 16 views are `security_invoker`, so a view
cannot bypass the policies on the table underneath it — without that, per-manager
RLS on the watchlist would be decorative.

### Cross-engine parity

Developing against DuckDB and shipping to Postgres only works if the two
actually agree, so [`generators/verify_parity.py`](generators/verify_parity.py)
runs 13 checks — including row-level comparisons across all 1,470 employees —
against both engines and exits non-zero on any difference.

It earned its place immediately by catching two bugs that raised no error on
either engine and would have shipped silently:

- **`NTILE(4)` ordered by `monthly_income` alone was non-deterministic.** NTILE
  forces equal-sized buckets, so employees sharing a salary that straddles a
  quartile boundary *must* be split — and which tied row landed in which bucket
  was arbitrary. Postgres and DuckDB disagreed by one employee on the Q3/Q4
  boundary. Fixed with an `employee_id` tiebreaker.
- **`::NUMERIC` with no precision meant two different things.** Postgres reads
  it as arbitrary precision; DuckDB defaults it to `DECIMAL(18,3)`. So
  `ROUND(x::NUMERIC, 4)` silently truncated pay percentiles to three decimals on
  DuckDB only, and the engines differed by up to 0.0005. Fixed with an explicit
  `NUMERIC(12,8)`.

Both were quiet wrong-answer bugs, which is the kind a test has to catch because
review will not.

Or with `psql` alone:

```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f sql/schema.sql
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f sql/seed_data.sql
for f in sql/views/*.sql; do psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f "$f"; done
```

## 8. What I'd do differently in production

**Ingestion.** The static CSV would be a scheduled pull from the HRIS (Workday,
BambooHR) via API into a staging schema, with dbt handling the transform into these
tables and `dbt test` enforcing the constraints that are currently only DDL checks.

**Point-in-time features.** The single biggest correctness gap. `tenure_years` is
measured at termination for leavers and at snapshot for actives, which is right for
"what did tenure look like when they left" but means the two classes see slightly
different distributions. A real feature store snapshotting every employee at a fixed
lookback date removes the whole class of bug described in section 5.

**Model monitoring.** `attrition_risk_scores` retains every run so drift is
*observable*, but nothing currently watches it. Production needs PSI on the feature
distributions, monthly retraining, and — crucially — **tracking whether flagged
employees actually left**, which is the only real measure of whether this works.
Right now there is no feedback loop.

**Row-level security.** The Watchlist names individuals. Managers must see only
their own team, via an RLS role on `DimEmployee[manager_name] = USERPRINCIPALNAME()`
mapped to Entra. Without it, every manager in the tenant can read every flight-risk
score in the company — a genuine HR-confidentiality failure, not a nice-to-have.

**Incremental refresh.** `compensation_history` and `performance_reviews` grow
monotonically; full refresh is fine at 1,470 employees and wrong at 50,000. Partition
on `effective_date` / `review_date` and refresh only the trailing window.

**Governance on the model output.** A flight-risk score attached to a named employee
is sensitive personal data. Production needs a retention policy on
`attrition_risk_scores`, an audit log of who viewed the watchlist, and an explicit
written policy that scores may never inform performance or termination decisions —
enforced by process, not just a disclaimer on a report page.

**Causal inference.** Every finding here is associational. "Overtime predicts
leaving" is not "cutting overtime will stop people leaving". The overtime finding is
strong enough to justify a proper test — a staggered rollout of workload caps across
teams, with difference-in-differences on the result.
