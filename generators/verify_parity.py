"""
Cross-engine parity test for the analytical view layer.

Runs the SAME queries against the live PostgreSQL database and against a local
DuckDB instance built from the CSVs, and asserts they return identical results.

WHY THIS EXISTS
    The views are developed and validated locally against DuckDB (fast, no
    server) but ship to Postgres, where Power BI reads them. That only works if
    the two engines actually agree, and twice they did not:

    1. NTILE(4) ORDER BY monthly_income alone. NTILE forces equal-sized
       buckets, so tied salaries straddling a quartile boundary MUST be split,
       and which tied row lands in which bucket was arbitrary. The engines
       disagreed by one employee on the Q3/Q4 boundary. Fixed with an
       employee_id tiebreaker.

    2. `::NUMERIC` with no precision. Postgres reads that as arbitrary
       precision; DuckDB defaults it to DECIMAL(18,3). ROUND(x::NUMERIC, 4)
       therefore truncated to three decimals on DuckDB only, and percentiles
       differed by up to 0.0005. Fixed with an explicit NUMERIC(12,8).

    Neither bug raised an error anywhere. Both would have shipped silently and
    made the dashboard disagree with the notebook. Hence a test.

    python generators/verify_parity.py

Exits non-zero on any mismatch, so it works as a CI gate.
